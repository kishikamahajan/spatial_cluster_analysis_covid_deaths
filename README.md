The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities in healthcare systems worldwide, with regions characterized by high pollution and poor healthcare infrastructure facing unique challenges. This study examines the spatial patterns of COVID-19 mortality in India, focusing on the Indo-Gangetic Plain, a region known for its severe air pollution and limited healthcare resources. Using district-level data, we explore the relationship between air pollution, healthcare infrastructure, age distribution, and migration trends to understand regional disparities in COVID-19 impact. We employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Medoids clustering to identify patterns and clusters of COVID-19 mortality. Our findings reveal that age is the most significant determinant of COVID-19 mortality, overshadowing the effects of pollution and healthcare infrastructure. Contrary to expectations, the Indo-Gangetic Plain does not exhibit the highest mortality rates, despite its unfavorable conditions. Instead, regions with older populations and higher migration activity experience the most severe outcomes. These results highlight the importance of considering demographic factors in public health planning and provide actionable insights for reducing COVID-19 mortality in future health crises. The study underscores the need for targeted interventions for older populations, improved healthcare infrastructure, and better management of migration patterns to mitigate the impact of future pandemics.
